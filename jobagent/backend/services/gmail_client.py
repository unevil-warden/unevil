"""Gmail integration with a mock fallback.

Real mode (Google OAuth configured): read recent threads, create unsent drafts,
and send a draft *only* when the user explicitly approves it. Scopes are limited
to readonly + compose + send — no modify/delete.

Mock mode (no credentials): return sample threads and store "drafts" locally only.
This keeps the whole app runnable on Linux/CI and powers the static demo.
